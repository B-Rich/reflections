What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?
A hidden .git subdirectory is created.  You need to do it, to begin to
track files/commits.  After saying git status, it will say "initial
commit", but no files are actually tracked yet, and there is actually
0 commits!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Once files have been added to the staging area, they can be
committed.  This is useful if you are probably only going to make
changes to those files (staged), to keep logical changes more
obvious.(?)
